# Individual-assignment-4

This is my individual assignment 4 submission for the website for my infotainment system. The system created is a static webpage built with HTML, CSS (bootstrap), and Javascript. The requiremnts of the assignment were to make an interactive infotainment system prototype that users could interact with.

To interact with the infotainment system:

1. Click on the 'End' Button to start the flow.
2. A pop up notifying you that you have declined the call pops up.
3. You can restart the function by clicking the 'Restart Flow' button.
